- Update Service

```bash
sudo cp bennycareserver.service /etc/systemd/system
```

- Enable and start

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now bennycareserver.service
```

- logs and status

```bash
systemctl status bennycareserver.service
journalctl -u bennycareserver.service -f
```

1) Edit the unit file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/bennycareserver.service

2) Tell systemd to re-read unit files
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

3) Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart bennycareserver.service

4) Check status + logs
systemctl status bennycareserver.service --no-pager
journalctl -u bennycareserver.service -n 60 --no-pager
